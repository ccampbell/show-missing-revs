**This script requires Subversion 1.5 or later**

Find revisions that have not been merged in subversion.

This script is useful if you have development happening simultaneously in multiple branches and have a hard time keeping track of what has and hasn't been merged.

Instructions:

cd to base directory of branch or trunk (does not work from subdirectory)
/path/to/./show_missing_revs -b (branch that you are merging into the current directory) -u (optional - username)

The script will output something like:
r9943 | bowser
r10123 | mario
r10127 | luigi
r10128 | luigi

This means those revisions are present in the branch specified by -b but not in the current branch.
